What?
--
Yet another Bittorrent client/library written in C with a BSD license. The client has been intended to be used as a drop-in bittorrent library. The client is in ALPHA and currently has 130+ unit tests covering the code base.

Why?
--
YABTorrent was spawned by:
1. There are not that many bittorrent clients in C that are licensed under non-copyleft licenses
2. There are not that many light weight torrent libraries which can be used for adding bittorrent-like download capability.
